Delete NPM packages in an organization.

First adjust the `executablePath` in `index.js` to point to your Chrome
executable, and `userDataDir` to a directory where Chrome can store its data.
Open Chrome and log in to *NPM*. Then navigate to the *settings page* of a package
in your organization, and enter your *one time password* or *login password* (this
is needed to enter *sudo mode* in NPM).

Then run:

```bash
$ node index.js "<org>"
```

Where `<org>` is the name of the organization you want to delete packages from.
This will open a Chrome window and start by first *scanning* all the package
names. Then it will open a new tab for each package and start deleting packages.
You can *stop* the process at any time by *closing the window*.
